# About this script
# =================
#
# What does it do?
# 
# It takes my memes, and downloads them to whatever 
# folder you choose. 
# [CONCEPT] You can pick which ones you want and 
# open them in your web browser or program of choice,
# be that an image editor or viewer, idc its ur choice,
# you can type in any program if its installed (and if
# it can open basic images, like .png's or .jpeg's, 
# although it'd be nice if it could open .webp's, too)
# and it will open it in that program.
