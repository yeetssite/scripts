# BASIC scripts/programs

#### IMPORTANT:

Please note that the BASIC interpeter used here is [TinyBASIC](https://github.com/cyningstan/tinybasic)(Homepage: [http://tinybasic.cyningstan.org.uk/](http://tinybasic.cyningstan.org.uk/)\), which has very specific syntax. To install it, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/cyningstan/tinybasic?tab=readme-ov-file#tiny-basic).

#### Running these files in TinyBASIC:

To run these BASIC scripts/programs simply use the following syntax:

```console
$ tinybasic [directory]/[file].bas
```
Make sure to replace `[directory]/[file]` with the path to the script you wanna run, e.g.:

```console
$ tinybasic ./myFirstBASICcode.bas
```
