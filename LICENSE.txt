Yeet's Shitty Software License v1.0  
Copyright (c) 2024 Jacob "Yeetsup" Hache

This license is not a legal document(don't bring it to court, stupid) and is more like a general agreement for the benifit of the author and the user.  
If you're wondering about legal stuff, the copyright act should have you covered(especially those living in the U.S.).

This license, unlike GPL, can be edited to your whims and needs(if you are the original author of this software). However, if you edit this license, you should stress that it's a modification of this one.

Let's start with a TL;DR:
This license probably has a lot of loopholes. That's okay, as this software is free to redistribute, resell, and modify to your hearts content. However, the author of this program wants it to be known where such
redistributions and resales came from, so make sure to credit them. Also, like GPL, you need to distribute this license alongside resold and redistributed copies of this license. If you are not the original author of
this software, you can't, CANNOT(I really have stress that you CAN'T) edit this license, and must keep it the same as the original author left it, e.g. if OA(OA stands for Original Author, you special star) 
made an edited version of this license, you must leave those edits intact, or if OA distributes this version of the license, you must also do the same.

TERMS AND/OR CONDITIONS

1. This software may be redistributed and modified, but this license, even if the original author changed it, must stay the same as it is in the unmodified/original software.
2. This License definitely has loopholes. If you manage to find one and use it, you earn the acheivment "get fucked" and you get to see your loophole worked out of the next revision.
3. If you redistribute this software, make sure you include OPs name in the credits, maybe in an "about" box for a gui or a "credits" command for a cli(it's your choice what the box is named or what command shows cred,
    as long as the credits are there and easily accessible).
4. If you are the original author and you decide to modify this license, make sure to add something about your license being a modified version of mine(yes, Jacob Hache writing here) near the top, e.g.:

		[Someone]'s shitty license v1.0
		Copyright (c) [year] [someone]
		This is a modified version of Yeet's Shitty Software License v1.0
		Yeets's Shitty Software License v1.0 Copyright (c) 2024 Jacob "Yeetsup" Hache

Wow, the 28 line license is finished!
