# scripts  
My bash and other assorted scripts

# use  
This repo is actually a github pages site (or at least it's gonna be) located at <`https://yeetssite.github.io/scripts/`>, but it has no content as it's specifically made to host files only.

It's meant to be easy to use with bash, but can contain other script types, too.

The idea is that you simply use something like `curl -O https://yeetssite.github.io/scripts/[SCRIPT]` and you can replace `[SCRIPT]` with a simple script name, no version numbers, no funky special characters, just a simple name like `yeetsmemes.sh`.

it's still a WIP and I'll work on it soon, but its 12:00a.m. at the time of writing this, and I like sleep.
