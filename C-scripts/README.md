# C

> Note: These scripts, as implied by the title above and the folder this README is in, require the program [c](https://github.com/ryanmjacobs/c/#C).  
> You should be able to use your package manager to install as instructed in the link, or if you're using Termux,
> via `$ pkg install c-script`.

### Running

Easy! Just type:

```console
~/scripts/C-script/$ c [script name].c
```

And remember to replace `[script name]` with the name of the script you wanna run!

### Compiling

`gcc` should have you covered:

```console
~/scripts/C-scripts/$ gcc -o [exec name] [script name].c
```

Replace `[exec name]` with the name of the executable/binary you wanna create and `[script name]` with the name of the script you wanna compile.
